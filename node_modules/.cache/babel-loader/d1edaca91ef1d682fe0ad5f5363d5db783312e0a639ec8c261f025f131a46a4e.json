The duality of my expertise has allowed me to navigate the intricate interplay between user interfaces and the resilient foundations that support them. The first three years found me immersed in the burgeoning tech landscape of Myanmar. Amidst the vibrant tapestry of local projects and diverse collaborations, I embraced the delicate artistry of crafting frontend experiences and the meticulous architecture of backend systems. It was a time of growth and discovery, as I cultivated a profound understanding of the nuanced challenges within the realm of software engineering. The subsequent two years unfolded in the tranquil embrace of Japan, a country where technological innovation converges with a sense of timeless precision. Here, amidst the serene amalgamation of tradition and progress, I delved deeper into the subtleties of both frontend and backend development. The Japanese ethos of perfection in craftsmanship subtly influenced my work, urging me to refine my skills with a quiet dedication. As the seasons of my professional journey change, so too do my aspirations. A calm whisper within me foretells a desire to specialize in frontend development. The prospect of weaving elegant and intuitive interfaces resonates deeply with my evolving sense of purpose. The tranquil rhythm of pixels aligning on a canvas feels like a natural progression, a contemplative path forward. Looking ahead, I see the future unfolding gently, like cherry blossoms drifting on a spring breeze.
